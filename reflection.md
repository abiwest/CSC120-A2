What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At first, I wasn't confident at all in how to reformat the various definitions into an object-oriented program style, even though I did have the video to refer to as well as the demo we did in class last week. I'm mostly refering to the ways that you have to assign the different objects into the def title (self, item_id, etc). Even though I was initially super confused, I luckily ended up realizing that it was more similar to the python coding I have done in the past than I initially thought. Once I started working on the different behaivoirs/information that the program needed, it went much faster because I was able to base a decent amount of it on the procedural example. When I finally thought I was done, a bunch of errors were produced which took me a while to figure out. It was helpful, however, that I could see the exact line that the error occured on, because this allowed me to just isolate one problem at a time. In general, The advice I would probably give someone taking this course in the future, or for myself when I work on another project similar to this is to try to break it down into much smaller steps at first. I think that some of the reason I was so overwhelmed in the beginning was that I was trying to figure out everything at once instead of slowing down and focusing on it piece by piece.
